Type Conversion 
------------------------
A type cast is basically a conversion from one type to another. 
There are two types of type conversion:

    bool -> char -> short int -> int -> 
       unsigned int -> long -> unsigned -> 
       long long -> float -> double -> long double


1. Implicit Type Conversion
    - Done by the compiler on its own, without any external trigger from the user.
    - Generally takes place when in an expression more than one data type is present. 
        In such condition type conversion (type promotion) takes place to avoid loss of data.
    - All the data types of the variables are upgraded to the data type of the variable with largest data type.

2. Explicit Type Conversion
    - This process is also called type casting and it is user defined. 
    - Here the user can type cast the result to make it of a particular data type.
    syntax:
        (type) variable 


Enumyrated Types
----------------------------------------
A 'enum' type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of 
predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one the values that have been
predefined for it.

In java enumurated dataytpes are declared using the keyoword called 'enum'.


Control flow statements and loops
----------------------------------------
if(condition){
    // code
}

if(condition){
    //code
}else{
    //code
}

while(condition){

}

do{
    //code
}while(condition)

for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){

}

switch(case){
    case '1':
        break
    case '2':
        break
    case '3':
        break
        .
        .
        .
        .
    default:
        break
}

break: Terminates the process or loop
continue: Skips the code after the continue and moves to the next iteration.
